# Netcat

A multiplatform version of netcat written in Rust

## What is Netcat?

Netcat (often abbreviated to nc) is a computer networking utility for reading from and writing to network connections using TCP or UDP. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netcat))

## Installation

### Build from source

Since you'll have to build the program, you'll need the Rust toolchain. You can download and install it [here](https://rust-lang.org/tools/install).

Once `rustup` is installed on your machine, you can run the following command:

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/eppeque/netcat
```

> This command will download the source code, build the program and make it runnable everywhere on your computer.

### Download the binary

You can also directly download the compiled binary available in the `Release` section of this repository.

*Enjoy!*
